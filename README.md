Implementation and Evaluation of a Case Study Using Machine Learning Techniques

In this project, I implemented and evaluated various machine-learning techniques for a given data modeling problem. The dataset and essential information were provided and can be accessed.

Key Tasks:

*Data Exploration: Conducted an in-depth dataset exploration to gain insights and understand its characteristics.

*Data Pre-processing: Performed necessary pre-processing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

*Machine Learning Method Selection and Implementation: Selected appropriate machine learning algorithms and implemented them to model the data effectively.

*Model Performance Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the implemented models using appropriate metrics and techniques to assess their effectiveness.

Additionally, a concise report was written summarizing the work and providing an analysis and discussion of the results. The report is approximately 1000 words long (excluding tables and figures) and has a maximum of five pages, including tables and figures.

Please refer to the GitHub repository for more details and code implementation. Feel free to explore the repository and reach out for any questions or collaborations.
